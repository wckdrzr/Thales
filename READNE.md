# Auto Build Number

This is a tool that consumes your C# domain models, types and controllers and exports them for other services and languages to consume.  Your C# models are available in TypeScript and your controller endpoints are available to TypeScript and other C# services, removing the need to hard code variable names and urls.

It's built from [Jonathan Svenheden's C# models to TypeScript project](https://github.com/svenheden/csharp-models-to-typescript) which makes use of the [Roslyn (the .NET compiler platform)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) to parse the source files, which removes the need to create and maintain our own parser.

## Supported Conversions

	    "Output": [{
			"Type": "TypeScript",
	    	"Location": "./api.d.ts"
	    },{
			"Type": "CSharp",
	    	"Location": "./ServiceComms/Api.cs"
		}],
		"CamelCaseEnums": false,
		"NumericEnums": true,
		"StringLiteralTypesInsteadOfEnums": false
	},
	"Controllers": {
		"Include": [
			"./Controllers/**/*.cs",
		],
		"Exclude": [],
		"Output": [{
			"Type": "Angular",
			"Location": "./service.ts",
			"ModelPath": "./api.d"
		}],
	    "Gateway": "api",
	    "ServiceName": "all"
	},
    "OnlyWhenAttributed": "FrontEnd",
    "CustomTypeTranslations": {
